Changing from a hosting plan that offers a database and php to a hosting plan that lacks these features - will result in your wordpress homepage not working anymore.

But there are wordpress plugins that allow you to transform your [wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) page into a static version (only using html and javascript), one such wordpress plugin is [Really Static](https://wordpress.org/plugins/really-static/).

After creating the static version of your homepage, deciding which folders of the old homepage need to remain on the webspace is a very difficult decision (as the dependencies are not obvious - use backups here whenever possible before trying to free more webspace).
