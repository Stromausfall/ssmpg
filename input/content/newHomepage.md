I've created a small generator that takes markdown files as input and generates a homepage from them (like the current version of the homepage).

The source is hosted on github (including the source needed to generate this homepage) : [https://github.com/Stromausfall/ssmpg](https://github.com/Stromausfall/ssmpg)
